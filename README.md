# The 1 Billion Row Challenge, in Rust

This challenge is over a year old as of my creating this, but it's just meant to be a learning experience in `rust`.

Rather than forking [1brc](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc), I created a separate repo because:
1. The challenge has been completed for over a year.
2. It's just to learn some stuff with `rust`.
3. I only really needed the [create_measurements.py](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/main/src/main/python/create_measurements.py) script (which I won't include in my code).
